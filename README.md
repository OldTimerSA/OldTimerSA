- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adrienne Harris from South Africa. Iâ€™m currently working in international development aid in Sub-Saharan countries and am also writing a book. I worked in IT in the early 1990's. My first job was formatting floppy disks - you can work out my age!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - aharris@harvestgroup.co.za or LinkedIn are the easiest for me. Please just remember that I work in many countries where the internet connectivity is terrible, so there could be a delay in my response.
